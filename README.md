## ü©∫ Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading global health concern. This web app predicts heart disease risk using trained ML models. It demonstrates real-world use of ML in healthcare through a user-friendly interface.

---

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Dual ML Models:**
  - **Decision Tree**: Fast, interpretable predictions.
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Predictions based on similarity.
- **User-Friendly Form**: Clean, responsive design for input.
- **Real-Time Results**: Displays prediction and confidence level.
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works on any device.

## üìä Dataset: `heart.csv`
Trained on UCI Heart Disease dataset with these features:

| Feature    | Description                                |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| age        | Age in years                               |
| sex        | Gender (0 = Female, 1 = Male)              |
| cp         | Chest pain type (0‚Äì3)                      |
| trestbps   | Resting blood pressure (mmHg)              |
| chol       | Serum cholesterol (mg/dL)                  |
| fbs        | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (0/1)      |
| restecg    | Resting ECG results (0‚Äì2)                  |
| thalach    | Maximum heart rate achieved                |
| exang      | Exercise-induced angina (0 = No, 1 = Yes)  |
| oldpeak    | ST depression from exercise                |
| slope      | Slope of ST segment (0‚Äì2)                  |
| ca         | Number of major vessels (0‚Äì3)              |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **User Input**: Fill out the health form.
2. **Preprocessing**: Input is scaled with `StandardScaler`.
   ```python
   scaled_input = scaler.transform([user_input])
